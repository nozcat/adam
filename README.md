# Adam - Developer AI Agent

## What is Adam?

Adam is a developer AI agent that automates the software development workflow by:

- **Pulling issues from Linear** - Continuously polls Linear for assigned issues
- **Implementing solutions** - Uses Claude Code to implement code changes based on issue requirements
- **Creating pull requests** - Automatically creates GitHub PRs for implemented changes
- **Responding to feedback** - Processes PR comments and feedback, implements requested changes, and responds to conversation threads
- **Managing Git workflow** - Handles branch creation, commits, and push operations

Adam runs in a continuous loop, checking for new issues and PR feedback every 30 seconds, making it a fully automated development assistant.

## Starting Adam

### Requirements

- **Node.js 24+** (latest LTS recommended)
- **Linear API access** - API key with read access to your Linear workspace
- **GitHub access** - Personal access token with repo permissions
- **Claude Code** - Adam uses Claude Code to implement changes
  - Install with: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
  - Requires authentication with your Anthropic account

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the following variables:
   ```env
   # Required
   LINEAR_API_KEY=your_linear_api_key
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username
   GITHUB_EMAIL=your_github_email

   # Optional
   BASE_BRANCH=main
   DEBUG=false
   ```

3. **Start Adam**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

Adam will begin polling Linear for assigned issues and processing them automatically.

## Docker Setup

Adam can also be run in a Docker container for easier deployment and isolation.

### Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code Authentication**: Claude Code must be authenticated before running Adam in Docker. This cannot be done inside the Docker container itself.

2. **Environment File**: Create a `.env` file with your configuration (see above for required variables).

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Prepare your environment file**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API keys and configuration
   ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t adam .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it -v /path/to/your/.env:/app/config/.env adam
   ```

4. **Authenticate Claude Code**:
   Once the container starts, you'll need to authenticate Claude Code:
   ```bash
   # In the container terminal that opens
   claude
   # Then type:
   /login
   # Follow the authentication prompts
   ```

5. **Start Adam**:
   After authentication is complete, Adam will start automatically and begin processing Linear issues.

### Alternative: Interactive Shell

If you need to troubleshoot or work interactively:
```bash
docker run -it -v /path/to/your/.env:/app/config/.env --entrypoint /bin/bash adam
```

Then manually:
1. Copy environment: `cp /app/config/.env /app/agents/adam/adam/.env`
2. Authenticate Claude Code: `claude` then `/login`
3. Start Adam: `npm run start`

### Docker Features

- **Ubuntu-based** with Node.js 24+ and common developer tools
- **Claude Code pre-installed** globally
- **Automatic repository cloning** from GitHub
- **Environment variable handling** via mounted `.env` file
- **Interactive authentication** support for Claude Code

### Important Notes

- **Authentication Requirement**: Claude Code authentication is required and must be done interactively after starting the container
- **Volume Mount**: Your `.env` file must be mounted to `/app/config/.env` in the container
- **Network Access**: The container needs internet access to communicate with Linear, GitHub, and Claude APIs
- **Persistent Data**: Consider mounting a volume for git repositories if you want to persist cloned repos between container restarts

### Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: If Claude Code fails to authenticate, ensure you have a valid Anthropic account and API access
- **Environment Variables**: Double-check that all required environment variables are set in your `.env` file
- **Network Connectivity**: Ensure the container has access to external APIs (Linear, GitHub, Claude)

## Workflow for Interacting with Adam

### 1. Repository Configuration

Each Linear project must specify the target repository in its content using the format:
```
REPOSITORY=owner/repo-name
```

This tells Adam which GitHub repository to work with for issues in that project.

### 2. Issue Assignment

- **Assign issues to Adam** in Linear (assign to the user whose LINEAR_API_KEY is being used)
- **Provide detailed descriptions** - Issues should be well-described with clear requirements
- **Ensure proper status** - Issues should be in an active state (not Backlog, Done, Canceled, or Duplicate)

### 3. Automated Implementation

Adam will:
- Detect the assigned issue
- Clone or update the target repository
- Create a branch for the issue (based on issue identifier)
- Use Claude Code to implement the changes
- Create a pull request with the implementation

### 4. PR Feedback and Iteration

- **Comment on pull requests** - Add comments or code review feedback
- **Interaction rules**:
  - Comments by `nozcat` are automatically processed
  - Comments by others are processed if `nozcat` reacts with üëç 
  - Adam adds üëÅÔ∏è reactions to indicate it's processing comments
- **Conversation threads** - Adam processes entire conversation threads, not just individual comments
- **Automatic responses** - Adam implements requested changes and responds to feedback

### 5. Merge and Complete

- **Review the implementation** - Check that changes meet requirements
- **Approve and merge** - Complete the PR when satisfied
- **Issue completion** - Adam handles the development workflow; issue status updates may need to be done manually in Linear

## Additional Features

- **Branch management** - Automatically creates and manages feature branches
- **Commit management** - Makes atomic commits with descriptive messages
- **Error handling** - Gracefully handles API failures and retries operations
- **Logging** - Comprehensive logging with colored output for monitoring
- **Continuous operation** - Runs continuously, processing new issues and feedback as they arrive

## Development

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Debugging
Set `DEBUG=true` in your `.env` file for verbose logging.
