   - The progression of the conversation and any decisions made

2. Determine if this conversation requires a coding change:
   - If YES: Make the necessary changes to address the feedback/requests in the conversation
   - If NO: Explain why no changes are needed

3. If you make changes:
   - Implement the changes completely
   - Test your changes if applicable
   - IMPORTANT: You MUST git add all changed files and commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
   - Do NOT skip the commit step - this is critical for the automation to work properly

4. Provide a response that summarizes:
   - What you analyzed from the conversation
   - Whether changes were made and what they were
   - Or why no changes were necessary
   - Any additional context that would be helpful

Your response should be suitable as a reply to the conversation thread. It should be friendly, consise, professional, and upbeat.`
